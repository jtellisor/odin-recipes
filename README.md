I will be creating a website of my favorite ingredients with the lessons I have learned through the Odin Project.
I think I am getting the hang of this! It had beenm really fun to create my own website; it has also been interesting to see how html's work and how to program them.
Unfortunately, I am still struggling a bit. I have the hang of certain commands, but other basics I am still getting use to. And I need to work on my attention to detail, as it has made many assignments a bit of a hassle to work on. In fact, this is my second attempt at doing this project.
But this time, I will get it right!
